A simple implementation of [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) in Keras for satellite image segmentation.

All code in [main.ipynb](https://github.com/wuhxxx/satellite-image-unet/blob/master/main.ipynb)

The dataset is free downloaded from [USGSâ€™s website](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). In this dataset, each pixel is labeled as one of 9 classes: water, developed, mechanical, mining barren, forest, grass, agriculture and non-mechanical.
